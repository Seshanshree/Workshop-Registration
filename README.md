# Workshop-Registration
Frontend Developer | Creative Web Designer | Electronics Enthusiast
I specialize in designing and developing modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on clean UI layouts, mobile-first design, structured components, and smooth user experience.

One of my featured projects is the “Tune Into Tech” Workshop Website, where I independently designed and developed a complete event landing page. The site includes:
• Responsive mobile-friendly layout
• Structured sections with clean alignment and spacing
• Countdown timer integration for live event tracking
• Interactive buttons and call-to-action elements
• Organized content flow for better readability
• Visual highlight sections for event promotion

Beyond design, I also conceptualized the technical workshop itself, where participants built FM radios and explored RF & SDR fundamentals — combining practical electronics with real-world wireless communication concepts.
